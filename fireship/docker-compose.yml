# provides docker instructions about how to connect and run multi containers tgt
version: "3" # specify the version of the docker-compose file format
services: # define the services that make up the application ie. we have 2 services: web and db
  web:
    build: . # build a custom img using the Dockerfile in the current directory
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
  db:
    image: "mysql" # use the official MySQL image from Docker Hub
    environment: # note that i can still use environment variables to configure the container
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    volumes: # take db-data volume created below and mount it to the /foo directory in the container
      - db-data:/foo

# creates a named volume called db-data
# this volume will be used to persist data for the MySQL database
volumes:
  db-data: # rhs empty as we are only creating a named volume without any specific configuration

# Volumes are used to persist data created and used by Docker containers.
# Without volumes, any data inside your container would be lost when the container is stopped or deleted.

# ðŸ§  Key Benefits of Volumes:
# Persist data across container restarts

# Share data between containers

# Store database files, logs, uploads, etc.
