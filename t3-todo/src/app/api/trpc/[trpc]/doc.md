# Explanation of `route.ts`

## Filepath:
`c:\Users\lauwe\side_projects\t3-todo-redo\get-it-right\src\app\api\trpc\[trpc]\route.ts`

## Notes from T3 Docs
This is the entry point for your API and exposes the tRPC router. Normally, you won’t touch this file very much, but if you need to, for example, enable CORS middleware or similar, it’s useful to know that the exported createNextApiHandler is a Next.js API handler↗ which takes a request↗ and response↗ object. This means that you can wrap the createNextApiHandler in any middleware you want.

---

## Purpose:
This file sets up the tRPC API endpoint for your Next.js application. It defines how HTTP requests to the `/api/trpc` endpoint are handled, including creating the tRPC context, routing requests to the appropriate tRPC procedures, and handling errors.

---

## Key Components:

### 1. **Imports**
```typescript
import { fetchRequestHandler } from "@trpc/server/adapters/fetch";
import { type NextRequest } from "next/server";

import { env } from "~/env";
import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc";
```
- **`fetchRequestHandler`**: A tRPC adapter that integrates tRPC with the Fetch API, used in Next.js for handling HTTP requests.
- **`NextRequest`**: Represents an incoming HTTP request in Next.js.
- **`env`**: Contains environment variables (e.g., `NODE_ENV`).
- **`appRouter`**: The main tRPC router that defines all the API routes and procedures.
- **`createTRPCContext`**: A helper function to create the tRPC context, which provides shared data (e.g., headers, session) to all tRPC procedures.

---

### 2. **`createContext` Function**
```typescript
const createContext = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  return createTRPCContext({
    headers: req.headers,
  });
};
```
- **Purpose**: Creates the tRPC context for each incoming request.
- **`req.headers`**: Passes the request headers to the context. This is useful for things like authentication (e.g., extracting a session token from headers).

---

### 3. **`handler` Function**
```typescript
const handler = (req: NextRequest) =>
  fetchRequestHandler({
    endpoint: "/api/trpc",
    req,
    router: appRouter,
    createContext: () => createContext(req),
    onError:
      env.NODE_ENV === "development"
        ? ({ path, error }) => {
            console.error(
              `❌ tRPC failed on ${path ?? "<no-path>"}: ${error.message}`,
            );
          }
        : undefined,
  });
```
- **Purpose**: Handles incoming HTTP requests to the `/api/trpc` endpoint.
- **Key Options**:
  - **`endpoint`**: Specifies the API endpoint (`/api/trpc`).
  - **`req`**: The incoming HTTP request.
  - **`router`**: The `appRouter` that defines all tRPC procedures.
  - **`createContext`**: A function to create the tRPC context for the request.
  - **`onError`**: Logs errors to the console in development mode. This helps debug issues with tRPC calls.

---

### 4. **Exporting the Handler**
```typescript
export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```
- **Purpose**: Exports the `handler` function for both `GET` and `POST` HTTP methods.
- This means the `/api/trpc` endpoint can handle both `GET` and `POST` requests, which is typical for tRPC since it uses HTTP for communication.

---

## How It Works:
1. **Incoming Request**:
   - When a request is made to `/api/trpc`, this file handles it.
   - The `handler` function is invoked with the `NextRequest` object.

2. **tRPC Context**:
   - The `createContext` function is called to create the tRPC context, which includes the request headers.

3. **Routing**:
   - The `fetchRequestHandler` routes the request to the appropriate tRPC procedure defined in the `appRouter`.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If an error occurs during the request, it is logged to the console in development mode.

---

## Example Use Case:
- A frontend client (e.g., React) makes a request to `/api/trpc/todo.create` to create a new todo item.
- This file:
  1. Creates the tRPC context with the request headers.
  2. Routes the request to the `create` procedure in the `todo` router (defined in `appRouter`).
  3. Returns the result of the procedure to the client.

---

## Summary:
This file acts as the entry point for your tRPC API in Next.js. It:
- Sets up the `/api/trpc` endpoint.
- Routes requests to the appropriate tRPC procedures.
- Creates the tRPC context for each request.
- Handles errors in development mode.

It integrates tRPC with Next.js's API routes, enabling type-safe, full-stack API calls.
