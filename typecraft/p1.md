ðŸ”¹ Containerization (e.g., Docker):
Allows you to run the same environment on different hardware, as long as that hardware can run Linux (or a Linux VM).

Containers include your app + its dependencies.

They share the host OS kernel (usually Linux).

This makes your software portable, lightweight, and reproducible.

âœ… Great for microservices, CI/CD, dev/prod parity, etc.

ðŸ§  Key point:
Containers do not virtualize hardware or OS â€” they just package software in a way that makes it work anywhere with the same kernel.

ðŸ”¹ Virtualization (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, KVM):
Allows you to run entirely different operating systems (like Windows, Linux, macOS) on the same physical machine.

Each VM has its own OS and kernel.

VMs run through a hypervisor (software that emulates hardware).

More resource-heavy, but more isolated and flexible.

âœ… Great for:

Testing across OSes (e.g., Windows, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)

Running legacy software

Isolated environments for security

ðŸ§  Key point:
Virtualization lets you run completely different systems side-by-side on one machine, each with full OS-level control.
